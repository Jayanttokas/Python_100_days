DAY 1
Basic of Python

----------------------------------------
Python has indentation errors, so always make sure indentation is correct
#to create a comment in python

-------------------------------------------
Variables
Variable names can be anything without spaces in between, variable name should be something that we can identify at later point in time as well. Also Variables can not have number in starting whereas they can have in between, 
certain names such as input, print which are functions in python cannot be variable names. If we need to have a name with space then _ to be used ex -> user_name = value not user name
If any variable used anywhere in function which is not defined it will throw an error  

name = input("what is your name") -> input is saved in variable "name"

can be used anywhere in the code
----------------------------------------------------------------

print("what you need to print")
print("what you neeed to print \n print now comes in next line")
print ("hello " + "Jayant") (concatenation)

-----------------------------------------

print ("hello" +input("what is your name?"))  -> output (hello name)

-------------------

To calculate the number of characters in a string
print(len(input()))  -> len() function calculates the no of characters in a string

First program

print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
street = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + street + " " + pet)
