Day 4 
 
Randomization and python list

to use random module in our code

import random
random_int =  random.randint(1, 10) -> random integer between 1 to 10 
print (random_int)

random_float =  random.random() -> it includes 0 and not 1 if anything is not defined. (defines a float)  
to expand the float range 
random_float = random.random() * 5 (now range becomes 0 to 4.9999)


module -> a module is basically set of code that is defined to a specific work / function
multiple modules working together is a function

to create a module 
create a new .py file define the functionality and then import the same file into the code file

List 

List is python data structure which is used to store the data. 
example = [a,b,c]

list always start with [] brackets. List start with [0] as the first entry not [1]. 
programmers start counting with 0 not 1.  if -1 then it is the last item of the list. 

to add a new item to the list
list.append("entry") -> this gets added to the list in the end of the list.
can check on documentation under data structure for different functions available for the list such as extend, insert, remove etc and how they are used as well.

if we go beyond the last item of the list then it will be an index error.

A list can have multiple list inside it. nested list also we can define. 

Fourth Program (Rock Paper scissors game)

import random

rock = '''
    _______
---'   ____)
      (_____)
      (_____)
      (____)
---.__(___)
'''

paper = '''
    _______
---'   ____)____
          ______)
          _______)
         _______)
---.__________)
'''

scissors = '''
    _______
---'   ____)____
          ______)
       __________)
      (____)
---.__(___)
'''

game_images = [rock, paper, scissors]

user_choice = int(input("What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.\n"))
print(game_images[user_choice])

computer_choice = random.randint(0, 2)
print("Computer chose:")
print(game_images[computer_choice])

if user_choice >= 3 or user_choice < 0: 
  print("You typed an invalid number, you lose!") 
elif user_choice == 0 and computer_choice == 2:
  print("You win!")
elif computer_choice == 0 and user_choice == 2:
  print("You lose")
elif computer_choice > user_choice:
  print("You lose")
elif user_choice > computer_choice:
  print("You win!")
elif computer_choice == user_choice:
  print("It's a draw")
