DAY 2

Data Types, mathematical operations, string manipluations


String -> String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters.
Print("hello"[0]) -> hello is a string gives the output h (Taking out character from string is called subscripting)

Integer ->Int. Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length
print(12+24) -> gives our sum i.e 36, if print("12"+"24") -> gives out 1224 as this is string we have mentioned
 
Float ->Floating point numbers are decimal values or fractional numbers like 133.5, 2897.11, and 3571.213, whereas real numbers like 56, 2, and 33 are called integers.
print(3.14) -> this is a Float number

Boolean ->The python data type bool is used to store two values i.e True and False

------------------------------------------------

print(type(variable)) -> gives out the type of variable it is i.e string, integar, float , boolean etc. 
str(variable) -> to convert the variable into string
float(variable) -> to convert to float
int(variable) -> to convert to int

------------------------------------------------

mathematical operations in python
3+5 -> addition
5-3 -> subtraction
8/2 -> division
3*2 -> multiplication
2**3 -> exponential (2 to power 3 = 8)

as there is BODMAS there is PEDMAS in Python
PEDMAS -> parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction

-----------------------------------------------

String Manipulations

print(round(8/3, 2)) -> it shows the output in round number i.e 2.67 in this case. value after the , tells us till which digit we need to round the numbers
print (8//3) -> this is floor division and it print out number 2 after rounding off.

score = 1
 
score += -> adds to score variable 
score -= -> subtracts to score variable
score *= -> multiply to score variable
Score /= -> divide to score variable

a string cannot be concatenated to an integer, if you dnt want to convert the integar first to str then follow f string for speeded up process
ex -> print(f" your score is {variable_which_is_int} you are winning by {Varibale_which_is_float}")

Day 2 Program
Tip Calculator

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Round the result to 2 decimal places.
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)


# FAQ: How to round to 2 decimal places?

# Find the answer in the Q&A here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/17965132#questions/13315048


print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
